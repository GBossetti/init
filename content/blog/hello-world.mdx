# Hello World

Welcome to my blog. This is where I share my thoughts on software development, technology, and other topics that interest me.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Software development practices
- Technologies I'm learning
- Projects I'm working on
- Lessons learned along the way

## A Code Example

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

Stay tuned for more content.
